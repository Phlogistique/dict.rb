Ease search in edict, kanjidic and kradfile

To install, make symbolic links to dict.rb named E, F, B, K and R in your
$PATH. Also change $dict_dir in the source to a directory containing properly
encoded edict, kanjidic and kradfile

Use:

$ E 言葉
Looks for a word containing "言葉"

$ E word
Looks for a word which definition contains "word"

$ E 言＜木世＞
Looks for a word containing 言, then a kanji containing radicals
木 and 世 (also works with F and B; you can also use <> instead
of ＜＞ but you will need quotes around them to escape them from
the shell)

$ F 言葉
Looks for the word "言葉"

$ F ことば
Looks for a word pronounced "kotoba"

$ B 言葉
Looks for a word beginning with "言葉"

$ R 木世
Looks for kanjis containing radicals 木 and 世

$ K 葉
Look for the kanji 葉

Ease search in edict, kanjidic and kradfile

To install, make symbolic links to dict.rb named E, F, B, K and R in your $PATH. Also change $dict_dir in the source to a directory containing properly encoded edict, kanjidic and kradfile

Use:

E 言葉       # Looks for a word containing "言葉"
E word       # Looks for a word which definition contains "word"
E 言＜木世＞ # Looks for a word containing 言, then a kanji containing radicals
             # 木 and 世 (also works with F and B; you can also use <> instead
             # of ＜＞ but you will need quotes around them to escape them from
             # the shell)

F 言葉       # Looks for the word "言葉"
F ことば     # Looks for a word pronounced "kotoba"

B 言葉       # Looks for a word beginning with "言葉"

R 木世       # Looks for kanjis containing radicals 木 and 世

K 葉         # Look for the kanji 葉
